# My Portfolio

Description: This is my portfolio that will  carry some of the projects I will be working on throughout the class. At the top of the page you will find a picture of me and a small introduction of myself and the website. To the right of the top of the page there will be three links that take you to my projects, contact, and about me. There are three sample projects as you scroll down the page that will contain my projects I plan to put in the future. Finally, at the bottom of the page there is a small get in touch box where you can input your information and send me a message. 


The link to my webpage is [My Portfolio] (http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#projects)
